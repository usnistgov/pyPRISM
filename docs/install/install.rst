.. warning::
    
    While the pyPRISM code is now publically available, the developers are
    still working on integrating the code into other systems (PyPI, Conda-Forge,
    Binder). We thank you for your patience as we work on these features. 

.. warning::
    
    While the developers aim to provide compatibility across operating systems
    and use cases, they expect installation to be a primary barrier for many
    users. After reading through this documentation, please file an issue on
    `GitHub <https://github.com/usnistgov/pyprism/>`__ if you run into
    problems.
