While the PRISM equation specifies the base PRISM formalism, we need additional
equations called closures to numerically solve the PRISM equations for
:math:`\hat{H}(k)` and :math:`\hat{C}(k)`. Closures provide a mathematical
relation between the direct correlation function :math:`c(r)`, the pairwise
interaction potential :math:`u(r)`, and, often, the total correlation function
:math:`h(r)`. Since the closures include :math:`u(r)`, it is through these
closures that the chemical details of the system are specified.
