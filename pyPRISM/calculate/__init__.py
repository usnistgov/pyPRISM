Once the PRISM equation is solved, :math:`\hat{H}(k)`, :math:`\hat{\Omega}(k)`, and
:math:`\hat{C}(k)` are used to calculate various structural and thermodynamic
properties.  As listed below, pyPRISM provides functions that calculate
these properties from solved :class:`pyPRISM.core.PRISM` objects. 

If a desired calculation is not listed, please consider filing an `Issue
<https://github.com/usnistgov/pyPRISM/issues>`_ on GitHub, implementing the
calculation, and sharing with the community. See :ref:`contribute` for more
details.
