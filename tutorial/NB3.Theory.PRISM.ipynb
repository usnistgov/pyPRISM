    "![](img/PRISM_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "PRISM theory describes the spatial correlations between spherical sites which represent either an atomic species or some collection of atoms in the molecule (e.g. a monomer or statistical segment of a polymer chain). By carrying out calculations with multiple site types, one can represent homopolymers with chemically complex monomers, polymer blends, copolymers, nanocomposites, and colloidal solutions. All information about the chemistry and connectively of these systems is encoded into the pair-interactions and intra-molecular correlation functions as will be discussed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for a material system that can be represented with $n$ types of sites, the PRISM equation is written in Fourier space as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}(k) = \\hat{\\Omega}(k)\\hat{C}(k) [\\hat{\\Omega}(k) + \\hat{H}(k)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\hat{H}(k)$, $\\hat{\\Omega}(k)$, and $\\hat{C}(k)$ as $n \\times n$ matrices of correlation values at wavenumber k. Note that the overhat notation and the functional designation $(k)$ indicate that these variables are functions in Fourier-Space. The above equation greatly benefits from the Fourier Convolution Theorem as it is a complicated integral equation in Real-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meaning of each of these variables is briefly discussion below for a three component system with site-types A, B, and C."
